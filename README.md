#rf butler

Lightwaverf home automation 433mhz control for Arduino,
without relying on the wifi-link hardware

Arduino home automation experiments. I have an arduino http://amzn.to/UCKWsq
with an ethernet shield, some LightwaveRF kit: http://amzn.to/RkukDo and
http://amzn.to/V7yPPK an rf transmitter and receiver http://bit.ly/HhltyI
and I'm trying to join them together.

It's still not really a robot butler.
